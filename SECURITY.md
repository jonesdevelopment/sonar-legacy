### Disclaimer

If BungeeCord/Waterfall/... has any vulnerabilities or exploits, people using Sonar will have to wait for the original BungeeCord/Waterfall/... developers to fix the issue(s).
This rule also applies to all dependencies or libraries your proxy instance or Sonar is using (for example: Log4J, Netty, ...).
