:heavy_exclamation_mark: **Sonar is now officially discontinued**

This is due to it being mostly finished and jones not having enough time to provide proper support.
The source code will be available on GitHub and the unlicensed, outdated jar can still be downloaded on BuiltByBit.
Sonar being discontinued does **not** mean that you won't be able to get Sonar anywhere.
Sonar will be a community project, which everyone can contribute to.
Issues will not be ignored and bugs will be fixed if jones has time to do so.

> You won't be able to download the **latest version** (on BuiltByBit) anymore

Thank you for everything, especially to the customers and the people I've met along my journey.
